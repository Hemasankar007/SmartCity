## Project Overview

The project focuses on leveraging data science methodologies and machine learning techniques to forecast traffic patterns in smart cities. It involves the collection and preprocessing of traffic data, feature engineering, the development of machine learning models, and the integration of real-time data sources for accurate predictions.

Key Features:

- Accurate forecasting of traffic patterns at major junctions
- Consideration of variations during holidays and special occasions
- Integration of real-time data feeds for up-to-date predictions
- Scalability and adaptability for expanding city infrastructure

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-pattern-forecasting.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the necessary datasets:

   - Follow the instructions in the `data/README.md` file to download and prepare the required datasets.

## Usage

1. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:


python preprocess.py


2. Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data:


python train.py


3. Integrate real-time data feeds by running the real-time data integration script:

python real_time_integration.py


4. Make traffic pattern forecasts using the trained model:


python predict.py


For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` directory.
